# ungrib

A build of the `ungrib` utility (note the lack of a `.exe` extension) from [WPS](https://github.com/wrf-model/WPS).

The value of the `WPSFILES` environment variable, exported when a conda environment installing this package is activated, is a directory containing the `namelist.wps` and `Vtable.GFS` files. Other variable-table files can be found in the WPS git repo.
